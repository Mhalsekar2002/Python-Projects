    "* **Encapsulation** - As we know, encapsulation is basically hiding the implementation part altogether as a single unit. If you can recall, in our previous project, we had individual methods for each functionality. But in this project, all the methods are encapsulated as a single unit in a class. This makes our project easy to maintain and understand.\n",
    "* **Reusability** - Since the beginning of OOP, we have learned that OOP helps in code reusability. But how exactly? Our project can be used by any library without making any • changes or customization. You just need to create a new object with the respective name of the library and the database. That's it! And you can implement it for any library with just a new object."
